Intro:

For this project we are building an autonomous vehicle based on the microcontroller Arduino Uno.


Description:

The vehicle has a Wi-Fi module attached and can be connected to a smart phone. You can control/drive the vehicle through the phone or you can set the movement to automatic and the vehicle will automatically avoid any obstacles and drive in a direction that it finds to be the least obstructed.

Additionally, we are planning on attaching a temperature sensor on the vehicle and the user can observe the temperature around the vehicle, on his/her phone.



For now only the code for the movement of the vehicle is uploaded, the code for the temperature sensor and phone synchronization is in progress.
